## User Stories
> User stories detailing app functionality<br />
* When a user goes to '/novascloset' they will see a home screen for Nova's Closets site and be able to choose what category to look/shop in ( i.e. costumes, treats, bandanas, etc).
* When a user clicks a category they will be taken to that categories index page that will show all the items being sold in that category. 
* When a user clicks an items image they will be directed to that specific items show page and there it will display the items image, description, and price.
​
### MVP Goals
* Have ONE model with all 7 RESTful routes working.
* Include Partials to make code cleaner
### Stretch Goals
* Add buy button that brings quantity down.
* If quantity is less than or equal to 10 it will display, under the price, how many of that item is left in stock.
*If out of stock it will say out of stock.
* Add admin route that allows only the admin to have access to the edit and delete functions throughout all models. 
* Have a Hamburger Nav Bar.
* Have 3-4 models that all render in one page and lead the user to their respective index and show pages.
* Add a cart that a user can add and remove items from. 

## Unsolved Problems
* Hiding the delete, create, and edit buttons/links so that they are only visible and accessible to 'admin'.
* Ability to import files from computer and have them display on all routes (not just index routes).
